Consider a tree, where every edge in the tree is coloured either in blue or in red.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.] Devise an efficient algorithm that counts how many trajectories from the source to the leafs contain \textbf{only} blue edges. The algorithm should not traverse a single node twice.
\item[b.] Now we want to count how many trajectories are there from source to the leafs that contain \textbf{at most} one blue edge.
Devise an efficient algorithm for this task.
\item[c.] Now we want to count how many trajectories are there from source to the leafs that contain \textbf{at most} $k$ blue edges, where $k>0$.
Devise an efficient algorithm for this task.
\end{enumerate}
