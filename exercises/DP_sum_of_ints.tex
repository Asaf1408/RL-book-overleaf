Given a list  of $n$ positive integer numbers $a_1,\dots,a_n$ and a positive integer $S$, answer the following question: does there exist a subset of the $a_i$'s that add up to S?
\begin{itemize}
\item[a.] Suppose that you are allowed to use each element $a_i$ any number of times. Give a dynamic programming algorithm that provides an answer in $\mathcal{O}(nS)$ operations (addition and comparison).
\item[b.] Suppose now that you are allowed to use each element $a_i$ at most once. Repeat the previous problem (with the same complexity requirement). \\
    \textbf{Hint:} Let $A_j = \{ a_1,\dots,a_j\}$. Consider iterating over $j$.
\end{itemize}
