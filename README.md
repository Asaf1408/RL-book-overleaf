# RL-book-overleaf

RL lectures notes / book draft
By Shie Mannor, Yishay Mansour and Aviv Tamar

Guidelines for submitting corrections:

Each chapter has its own .tex file. This is where you can make changes. You can propose a change by making a pull request.
See the guides here: https://guides.github.com/

Important: please follow the notations in the files by using the macros that we already use (e.g., \state, \action, \Value). 
The common notation and macros are defined in Lecture_Book.tex

Please make sure there are no compilation errors for the changes you propose (by compiling the latex yourself on your machine or on overleaf).

RL-book.tex can be used to generate the pdf for the whole book. Do not push changes to this file.
class_handouts.tex can be used to generate the pdf for the most recent lecture. Do not push changes to this file.

A bonus will be given to avid contributors.
