Lecture 2: The Average reward DDP algorithm. Add the corrections from the IPL paper.

Lecture 3: Markov chains. Add a running example (small 3x3 or 4x4 matrix)

Lecture 4: discounted
add the running example from the slides

Lecture 5: model based
Redo the Rmax algorithm and the analysis

Lecture 6: Q-learning
Add examples (from slides?)
Exercise: show that the observed model is the maximum likelihood model.
